VibeSaber
=========

A Beat Saber mod that adds vibration control through [Intiface](https://intiface.com/desktop/). It provides deeper integration than the normal Game Haptics Router, allowing you to customize your experience to your liking.

--------

**WARNING:** This mod is currently unstable and you are guarrenteed to run into some bugs. For example, due to arcane programming gremlins, BEAT SABER WILL HANG WHEN YOU EXIT IT. This is expected behavior and until I manage to exorcise the code demons you will have to force-quit it from windows.
